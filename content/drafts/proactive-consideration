the golden rule used to be "treat others how you'd like to be treated".

thats not true when you have different standards for how you'd like to be treated.

in most social settings there is an emphasis on the recipient's interpretation rather than the author's intention.

which means how *they*'d like to be treated is more important than how you'd like to be treated.

the best time to do this is *before* you act.
