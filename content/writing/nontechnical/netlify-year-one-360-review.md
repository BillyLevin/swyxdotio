I thought I would write a quick coda to my [Netlify Year One](https://www.swyx.io/writing/netlify-year-one) Recap. That post was entirely me looking back at myself. It's helpful to see what others said about me at my review.

## What I've Done Well

- Diligent
- Shares knowledge
- Hard worker, prolific, motivated
- Great eye for new features and developer experience
- Constantly thinking about how to drive Netlify forward in terms of business goals, product features and community engagement
- Live and breathe the JS and particularly React landscape. Bridge gap with community.
- Attentive to trends, new developments and the pulse of the community
- Jump on tasks
- Articles that are topical and interesting

## What I could Improve

- Communication
- Communication
- Communication

Basically people think I:

- move fast and skip steps
- dont provide enough context in issues or externally
  - In particular, longer explanations to customers, not imperative: do this, do that
  - provide more context in GH repos
- am not engaged in calls/dont value others contributions to conversations/dont pay attention when others are speaking
- working on too many things at once

People want me to turn technical acumen into technical leadership.

I had a comment that "sometimes has a tendency to pursue his own avenues of interest and focus". I have no intention to change this.

## My Resolutions from my 360

- TAKE THINGS IN. LISTEN. ATTENTIVE.
- COMMUNICATE EXPLAIN AT LENGTH AND DELIBERATIVELY.
- Continue to give thoughtful compliments in public to analyze what I like about what they do, breaking apart what they did.
