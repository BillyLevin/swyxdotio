I've been feeling like I've skewed too much on empty calories recently. So I ran [this poll](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1168182079613485056):

> Number of books youâ€™ve read in the past year (fiction and non fiction):

Of 962 respondents, 25% didn't read any books, 35% read 1-3, 24% read 4-9, 16% were > 10.

I'm a 1-3 kind of guy and would love to up it. Many folks obliged with their goodreads lists:
