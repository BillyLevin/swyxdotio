description: Patrick McKenzie's simple concept for making friends on the Internet.
---

A **"Friendcatcher"** is something you offer for free, that helps you catch friends.

Because it is passive, it is an asset. Just like a [Dreamcatcher](https://legomenon.com/dreamcatcher-meaning-legend-history-origins.html) can be hung over your bed once and catches bad dreams for you through the night, a "Friendcatcher" (*one word, not hyphenated*) catches friends for you without you even trying.

The concept comes from [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Apatio11%20friend-catcher&src=typed_query), who in turn says it came from his mom. As loud and well known as he is, this concept doesn't seem widely known, and that is a pity. I first heard of it at Microconf, and it's unintentionally informed my most successful online projects so far.

## Friendcatching for Dummies

[In the words of Patrick's mom](https://youtu.be/PtmUJye7t4c?t=744):

> Patrick, you should learn to cook. Don't learn to cook because you want to eat food - learn to cook because if you learn to cook you will have an excuse for the rest of your life to bring people over to your house. **No one who knows how to cook will ever lack for friends.**

Patrick's mom wasn't talking about content strategy, or customer research, but she might as well have been.

[In my notes from his talk](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/992100623934935041):

> Platform Before Product.
> 
> Build the things that will allow you to engage an audience and improve it over time. Included in this: Friendcatchers.
> Friendcatchers are small, contained lists, essays or apps that solve resonant (emotional, relevant), tractable, underserved problems.

The ideal Friendcatcher is (thanks to [Christian Genco](https://microconf.gen.co/patrick-mckenzie/) and the [Microconf video](https://youtu.be/PtmUJye7t4c?t=822)):

- **Tractable**: Solvable within the blogpost, guide, cheatsheet, or mini-app form factor you have picked.
- **Resonant**: People say "F*** yeah this is what I need!" when they see your thing. Pay attention to pain.
- **Underserved**: 101 guides are overdone. Do the 201 guide. Cover intersections of technologies.

Basically: **"Fill holes in the Internet".**

## What a Friendcatcher does for you

*(This is swyx talking)* A Friendcatcher performs these functions:

- Solves someone's problem.  Some indications: 
  - Reader's Googling stops at you. 
  - Reader repeatedly returns to refer to your thing.
  - Reader tells you.
- Establishes your expertise and association with the problem
- Makes the reader look smart/funny/informed when they share your thing
  - It is "Retweetable" - doesn't contain miscellaneous/unrelated junk, is timeless
- Gives the reader a benefit, which you can cash in on in future
  - [Reciprocity is powerful](https://www.influenceatwork.com/principles-of-persuasion/)
- Does its job without your involvement after creation
  - This is [Leverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtyWqj2ESiQ), a form of [Productize Yourself](https://nav.al/productize-yourself)

A **"Learn in Public" Friendcatcher** also invites readers to ask about things you don't answer, and to correct things you got wrong. This is **open source, collaborative knowledge.**

- Blogging
  - [Patrick in 2010](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1002272): *Blogging is also a friendcatcher, sometimes even literally for me. It gets you opportunities you would not have if you did not blog. I am here at a SEO-skeptical company getting paid handsomely to make them scads because I blogged.*

  - *Fog Creek and Basecamp (formerly known as 37signals) both were extraordinarily successful with using writing as a friendcatcher both for their philosophies of the world and, secondarily, for their paid products. Many SaaS companies have cottoned onto the fact that writing (and podcasting, and making videos, and the like) is often less expensive than leasing traffic from Google on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, many make mistakes in tactics and strategies which blunt the good that writing can do for their audience and their business.*
