draft: android vs ios üçé

android

- browser doesnt shut down
- usb c
- price
- account integration genuinely better. password suggestions work.
- screenshot workflow nicer
- better nfc experience
- real filesystem
- wifi signin is GREAT
- calendar Integration
- custom widget on app store
- sign in with Google accounts on chrome
- better amp link copying

ios

- swipe back from edge
- fewer accidental triggers of navigation 
- left swipe feed is way more customizable - google just says google
- more apps prioritize - eg superhuman, github
- better emoji keyboard
- better dark mode - bc TMobile sucks.
- camera
- paste flow just works
- you can cancel accidental browser clicks
surprises
- overcast is ios only - podcast addict too cluttered, doesnt have nice detail to list flow, skip not supported. sound controls in general better on ios
- has fucking undo
- has assistive touch to toggle grayscale/invert
- never installed pwa
- alarm app calls itself an alarm app
- navigation away from keyboard
- readability mode http://www.foundersatwork.com/steve-wozniak.html
