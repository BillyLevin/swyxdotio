I just came off organizing [Svelte Society 4](https://www.downtomeet.com/Svelte-Society-NYC/Svelte-Society-NYC-4-Fab-Feb-1162378) today.

Of course this is a little bit self serving given my React and TypeScript community work. But I do wonder about the multiplicative potential of such a concept. 

You can write the best code in the world but if you don't rally people around to use it then it is going to have limited impact.

You can rally people and have great impact with no code at all.
