Today I dropped out of the Compilers course I accidentally registered myself for. I'm not proud of it but there's too much I want to do and I know I'm just going to do a shit job at everything by spreading my self thin and also putting an intense gun to my head.

For posterity here are some materials for my future reference.

the rest are pdfs located in the same folder
