This is a stub for a future blogpost. Please [yell at me](https://twitter.com/swyx) if you have particular questions or comments on this topic I should include.

Plan

- talk about my tweet
- talk about why it is impossible/fatiguing to learn everything
- we are hopelessly bad at evaluating tools anyway. stop pretending we can.
- talk about how productive you can get with general purpose tools and languages
- conclusion - we don't agree on what the job -is-. Most of the time it is something much higher level, therefore individual implementation detail doesnt matter. Also our requirements change often (often after release), and general purpose tools optimize for change more than specialized tools - aka, the job shifts.
