shortdesc: diving into the history of CRA, how CRA works, and my experience making create-react-app-parcel
description: We all use create-react-app but how much do we know about how it works internally? In this talk we discuss how I recently dived into the source code for create-react-app to make a fun clone! It looks intimidating but is really not, once you get a hang of how lerna monorepos work and try making one of your own. Watch this and then go make your own create-awesome-app!
