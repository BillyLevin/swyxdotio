JavaScript is moving so fast. It’s not easy to keep up with all of the frameworks, build tools, and packages. No other language spans frontend to backend, mobile to web to server.

Sacha Greif is an independent designer and developer most prominent in his roles as co-author of Discover Meteor and community builder at Sidebar.io, a design newsletter with over 35,000 subscribers, and Hacker News Kansai. He is currently best known in the Javascript community as the maintainer of VulcanJS, and for his annual State of Javascript survey which is now open for 2017.

In this episode, Shawn Wang guests hosts a discussion about both projects and Sacha’s thoughts on independent web design and development.
