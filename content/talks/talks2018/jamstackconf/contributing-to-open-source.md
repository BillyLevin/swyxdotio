# Why Contribute to Open Source

1. Giving back to community
2. Learning your library/tool (especially helping out in docs)
3. Learning your language
4. Building a public/portable portfolio
5. Working in a distributed/remote team
6. Practicing building things e.g. https://github.com/sw-yx/create-react-app-parcel
7. Mentorship from Seniors
8. Material for blogposts and talks ðŸ˜Ž

## It doesn't have to be code

- Official docs can always be better. Translation, updating, clarifying with a beginners mind
- Make your own unofficial docs or blogposts https://github.com/sw-yx/react-typescript-cheatsheet/
- You can help triage issues when people file them - you will get very very good at answering Frequently Asked Questions and tha frees up time for maintainers to do more
- Answer questions nicely on StackOverflow, Gitter, Twitter, etc

## It doesn't have to be CORE code

- You can make helper libraries on top of the library to solve common problems people face
- You can help write tests

## How to Get Started

- Projects you definitely use
  - FreeCodeCamp
