Shawn explains his Learn In Public manifesto. They discuss the benefits of learning in public and how concepts like Cunninham’s Law and lampshading can be a good thing. Shawn talks about the differences between inbound and outbound marketing. The two biggest benefits of learning in public is that people will come to help you, it helps you to build capital, and it os the fastest way to learn.

The sequence of how this one happened was pretty fun. I noticed an a11y fight on Twitter, and posted about it on the Netlify slack. then Leslie picked up the torch and [wrote a blogpost about it](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/25/accessibility-is-not-a-react-problem/). That got her invited onto the podcast and she became a panelist. And then she invited me. and now we're here.
