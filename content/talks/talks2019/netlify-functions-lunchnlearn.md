Making dynamic app functionality on the JAMstack often involves writing custom APIs as "glue code", "token hiders" and other business logic traditionally done on the server. Even _without_ a JAMstack architecture, serverless functions can be a great add-on, autoscaling solution for additional functionality for existing apps. It should be -easy- to spin up these serverless functions, but learning, testing and deploying them can often be more trouble than they are worth.

This show-and-tell session will look at what you can do with serverless functions, how to get started creating and locally testing them with Netlify Dev, and finally deploying them as Netlify Functions with atomic deployments and instant rollbacks. Static has never looked this dynamic!
