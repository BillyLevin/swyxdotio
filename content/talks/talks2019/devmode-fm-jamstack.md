On this episode, we talk to Shawn ​“swyx” Wang from Netli­fy about the JAM­stack & Server­less rev­o­lu­tion in fron­tend development.


We dis­cuss what exact­ly Netli­fy is, and how you can lever­age the Edge, Build, and Dev aspect of it to make your devel­op­ment process more enjoyable.


We talk about the chal­lenges of main­tain­ing Author Expe­ri­ence (AX) in the age of sta­t­ic site gen­er­a­tors, using Live Pre­view func­tions in a CMS or ser­vice to help out.


We also talk about how JavaScript edge work­ers will gain sen­tience as Skynet, and the AI lan­guage mod­el that was so dan­ger­ous they could­n’t release it.
