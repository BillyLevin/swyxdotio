I look upon this fondly as the first group project that I led; git conflicts, daily standups and all. This was done over the course of ~7 days.

I played a key part in the design ([adapted from Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/)) 
and was singly responsible for the admin panel functionality ([which I blogged about on my devblog](https://sw-yx.github.io/)).

The backend was done entirely TDD and I even wrote [a guide to Authentication API testing](https://github.com/sw-yx/AuthApiTesting/) as a result of the TDD process.

I also implemented the email confirmation (using [mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io) and `pug` templates [from Wes Bos](https://learnnode.com/)) and [stripe payment](https://github.com/azmenak/react-stripe-checkout) functionalities.

Feedback from teammates
---

- (from me to me) I learn quickly and I like teaching others what I have just learned.
- Solid experience, insight, and skill with an eye for efficiency; team-oriented; patience; open to teaching and helping others; checking-in with team periodically and setting a high, achievable bar; raising team morale
- Shawn is amazing - He can accomplish so much, so fast, so patiently, and is always willing to show us what he did and how. I hope I can be that way one day too!
- Thank you for pushing us, throwing me into tasks that I initially had trepidation with, and helping me realize that I know more than I think. It's an absolute privilege to work with you.
