Another one of my learn-by-teaching projects.

I realized that people like myself don't really understand how to truly set up React and Webpack from scratch so I decided to make my own course materials and Reactify a familiar project.

Two fellow students were kind enough to join me for this workshop and I think it was fairly successful.

I still refer to this Readme every now and then when documentation gets too overwhelming :)
