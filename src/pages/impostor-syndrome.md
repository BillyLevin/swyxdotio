I guest [hosted for Software Engineering Daily in July](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/08/09/state-of-javascript-with-sacha-greif/) and while that was fun, one of the options for episode formats was for a longer form NPR style narrative storytelling episode.

Recording a longitudinal study and series of interviews is of course absurdly hard to do by a reporter with funding, much less a small podcaster with daily show obligations.

But it is not so hard if the host is already living through it anyway.

When I joined Fullstack I spammed invitations until I found 8 panelists willing to do this with me.

And then, with their help and some special guests, I started doing it.

We are only 3/4 of the way done. This is still a work in progress.
